Monad is the next generation platform for administrative automation. Monad solves traditional management problems by leveraging the .Net Platform. From our prototype (though limited), we can project significant benefits to developers, testers, power users, and administrators. Monad leverages the .NET Common Runtime to provide a powerful, consistent, intuitive, extensible and useful set of tools that drive down costs of administration and make the life of non-programmers a lot easier. Monad consists of1. Monad Automation Model (MAM) An automation model based upon .Net classes, methods and attributes to produce Cmdlets.2. Monad Shell (MSH) A .Net based script execution environment for exposing Cmdlets as APIs command line tools and interactive programmable command line shell.3. Monad Management Models (MMM) The set managed code base classes (or interfaces) to implement specific management scenarios and in-the-box administrative tools to execute those scenarios.4. Monad Remote Scripting (MRS) A set of Web Service based components that allow scripts to be remotely executed on many machines.5. Monad Management Console (MMC). A .Net based model and set of services for building management GUIs on top of MSH and exposing all GUI interactions as user-visible scripts.
